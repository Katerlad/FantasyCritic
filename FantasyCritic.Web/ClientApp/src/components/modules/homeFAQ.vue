      <div slot="question">
        Why should I play FantasyCritic?
      </div>
      <div slot="answer">
        It’s a great catalyst for discussing video games with your friends, and gets everyone invested in checking out the year’s best video games.

        Does this cost money?
      </div>
      <div slot="answer">
        No. It’s totally free. No catch. For now, this is a passion project for me and I’m comfortable eating the cost of servers and advertising.
        In the future, it is possible that I will consider adding advertising or opening a Patreon, but I’m never going to charge people to play.

      <div slot="question">
        How many players can be in a league?
      </div>
      <div slot="answer">
        Anywhere from 2 to 20. Somewhere between 4 and 10 is probably optimal, and I'd be apprehensive about going over 14, but you can do it.

      <div slot="question">
        How long does a league last?
      </div>
      <div slot="answer">
        Each calendar year is one “game” of Fantasy Critic. Everyone starts fresh with a new roster at the start of each new year,
        but you are free to keep playing in the same league with the same people year after year.
